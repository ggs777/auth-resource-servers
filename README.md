In this video, you'll learn how to implement JWT authentication and authorization in a Spring Boot 3.0 application using Spring Security 6 and a Postgres database to store user credentials. 

You'll see how easy it is to secure your application and protect your endpoints using JSON Web Tokens. We'll start by setting up a Postgres database and creating a user table to store our credentials. 

Then, we'll configure Spring Security to use JWT and define some security rules for our application. Finally, we'll test our setup by building a simple API and using Postman to send authenticated requests. 

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this tutorial will give you the tools you need to secure your Spring Boot application with JWT authentication and authorization.
